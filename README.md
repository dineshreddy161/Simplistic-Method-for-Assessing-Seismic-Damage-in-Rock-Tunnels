The SDART (Seismic Damage Analyzer for Rock Tunnels) tool can be used for two main purposes:


      1. Seismic Vulnerability of Rock Tunnels (SVRT):
        - Evaluate the SVRT using Reddy and Singh's approach.
        - Predicts the Damage class and probable damages to tunnel before an Earthquake.
        - Assumes tunnels are not designed for seismicity.
        - Can perform for locations in India and adjacent countries.
        - Analysis performed within a threshold distance of 250 km.
        - PGA is calculated using the attenuation relationship of Kanno et al. (2006).    
    
     
     
     2. Deterministic Seismic Hazard Analysis (DSHA):
        - Assess the deterministic seismic hazard of sites.
        - Can perform for locations in India and adjacent countries.
        - Analysis performed within a threshold distance of 250 km.
        - PGA is calculated using the attenuation relationship of Kanno et al. (2006).
     You can generate reports and bar graphs for SVRT or DSHA as needed.
